    <excerpt>&lt;b&gt;PrologueHouse of the Temple8:33 P.M.&amp;#160;&lt;/b&gt;The secret is how to die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since
        the beginning of time, the secret had always been how to die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thirty-four-year-old
        initiate gazed down at the human skull cradled in his palms. The skull was hollow, like a bowl, filled with
        bloodred wine.&lt;i&gt;Drink it, &lt;/i&gt;he told himself. &lt;i&gt;You have nothing to fear.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#160;As
        was tradition, he had begun this journey adorned in the ritualistic garb of a medieval heretic being led to the
        gallows, his loose-fitting shirt gaping open to reveal his pale chest, his left pant leg rolled up to the knee,
        and his right sleeve rolled up to the elbow. Around his neck hung a heavy rope noose&amp;mdash;a &quot;cable-tow&quot;
        as the brethren called it. Tonight, however, like the brethren bearing witness, he was dressed as a master.The
        assembly of brothers encircling him all were adorned in their full regalia of lambskin aprons, sashes, and white
        gloves. Around their necks hung ceremonial jewels that glistened like ghostly eyes in the muted light. Many of
        these men held powerful stations in life, and yet the initiate knew their worldly ranks meant nothing within
        these walls. Here all men were equals, sworn brothers sharing a mystical bond.As he surveyed the daunting
        assembly, the initiate wondered who on the outside would ever believe that this collection of men would assemble
        in one place . . . much less &lt;i&gt;this &lt;/i&gt;place. The room looked like a holy sanctuary from the
        ancient world.The truth, however, was stranger still.&lt;i&gt;I am just blocks away from the White House.&lt;/i&gt;This
        colossal edifice, located at 1733 Sixteenth Street NW in Washington, D.C., was a replica of a pre-Christian
        temple&amp;mdash;the temple of King Mausolus, the original &lt;i&gt;mausoleum . . . &lt;/i&gt;a place to be
        taken after death. Outside the main entrance, two seventeen-ton sphinxes guarded the bronze doors. The interior
        was an ornate labyrinth of ritualistic chambers, halls, sealed vaults, libraries, and even a hollow wall that
        held the remains of two human bodies. The initiate had been told every room in this building held a secret, and
        yet he knew no room held deeper secrets than the gigantic chamber in which he was currently kneeling with a
        skull cradled in his palms.&lt;i&gt;The Temple Room.&lt;/i&gt;This room was a perfect square. And cavernous. The
        ceiling soared an astonishing one hundred feet overhead, supported by monolithic columns of green granite. A
        tiered gallery of dark Russian walnut seats with hand-tooled pigskin encircled the room. A
        thirty-three-foot-tall throne dominated the western wall, with a concealed pipe organ opposite it. The walls
        were a kaleidoscope of ancient symbols . . . Egyptian, Hebraic, astronomical, alchemical, and others yet
        unknown.Tonight, the Temple Room was lit by a series of precisely arranged candles. Their dim glow was aided
        only by a pale shaft of moonlight that filtered down through the expansive oculus in the ceiling and illuminated
        the room's most startling feature&amp;mdash;an enormous altar hewn from a solid block of polished Belgian black
        marble, situated dead center of the square chamber.&lt;i&gt;The secret is how to die, &lt;/i&gt;the initiate
        reminded himself.&quot;It is time,&quot; a voice whispered.The initiate let his gaze climb the distinguished
        white-robed figure standing before him. &lt;i&gt;The Supreme Worshipful Master. &lt;/i&gt;The man, in his late
        fifties, was an American icon, well loved, robust, and incalculably wealthy. His once-dark hair was turning
        silver, and his famous visage reflected a lifetime of power and a vigorous intellect.&quot;Take the oath,&quot;
        the Worshipful Master said, his voice soft like falling snow. &quot;Complete your journey.&quot;The initiate's
        journey, like all such journeys, had begun at the first degree. On that night, in a ritual similar to this one,
        the Worshipful Master had blindfolded him with a velvet hoodwink and pressed a ceremonial dagger to his bare
        chest, demanding: &quot;Do you seriously declare on your honor, uninfluenced by mercenary or any other unworthy
        motive, that you freely and voluntarily offer yourself as a candidate for the mysteries and privileges of this
        brotherhood?&quot;&quot;I do,&quot; the initiate had lied.&quot;Then let this be a sting to your consciousness,&quot;
        the master had warned him, &quot;as well as instant death should you ever betray the secrets to be imparted to
        you.&quot;At the time, the initiate had felt no fear. &lt;i&gt;They will never know my true purpose here.&lt;/i&gt;Tonight,
        however, he sensed a foreboding solemnity in the Temple Room, and his mind began replaying all the dire warnings
        he had been given on his journey, threats of terrible consequences if he ever shared the ancient secrets he was
        about to learn: &lt;i&gt;Throat cut from ear to ear . . . tongue torn out by its roots . . . bowels taken out
        and burned . . . scattered to the four winds of heaven . . . heart plucked out and given to the beasts of the
        field&amp;mdash;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;Brother,&quot; the gray-eyed master said, placing his left hand on the
        initiate's shoulder. &quot;Take the final oath.&quot;Steeling himself for the last step of his journey, the
        initiate shifted his muscular frame and turned his attention back to the skull cradled in his palms. The crimson
        wine looked almost black in the dim candlelight. The chamber had fallen deathly silent, and he could feel all of
        the witnesses watching him, waiting for him to take his final oath and join their elite ranks.&lt;i&gt;Tonight,
        &lt;/i&gt;he thought, &lt;i&gt;something is taking place within these walls that has never before occurred in
        the history of this brotherhood. Not once, in centuries.&lt;/i&gt;He knew it would be the spark . . . and it
        would give him unfathomable power. Energized, he drew a breath and spoke aloud the same words that countless men
        had spoken before him in countries all over the world.&lt;i&gt;&quot;May this wine I now drink become a deadly
        poison to me . . . should I ever knowingly or willfully violate my oath.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;His words echoed in the
        hollow space.Then all was quiet.Steadying his hands, the initiate raised the skull to his mouth and felt his
        lips touch the dry bone. He closed his eyes and tipped the skull toward his mouth, drinking the wine in long,
        deep swallows. When the last drop was gone, he lowered the skull.For an instant, he thought he felt his lungs
        growing tight, and his heart began to pound wildly. &lt;i&gt;My God, they know! &lt;/i&gt;Then, as quickly as it
        came, the feeling passed.A pleasant warmth began to stream through his body. The initiate exhaled, smiling
        inwardly as he gazed up at the unsuspecting gray-eyed man who had foolishly admitted him into this brotherhood's
        most secretive ranks.&lt;i&gt;Soon you will lose everything you hold most dear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter
        1&lt;/b&gt;The Otis elevator climbing the south pillar of the Eiffel Tower was overflowing with tourists. Inside
        the cramped lift, an austere businessman in a pressed suit gazed down at the boy beside him. &quot;You look
        pale, son. You should have stayed on the ground.&quot;&quot;I'm okay . . .&quot; the boy answered, struggling to
        control his anxiety. &quot;I'll get out on the next level.&quot; &lt;i&gt;I can't breathe.&lt;/i&gt;The man
        leaned closer. &quot;I thought by now you would have gotten over this.&quot; He brushed the child's cheek
        affectionately.The boy felt ashamed to disappoint his father, but he could barely hear through the ringing in
        his ears. &lt;i&gt;I can't breathe. I've got to get out of this box!&lt;/i&gt;The elevator operator was saying
        something reassuring about the lift's articulated pistons and puddled-iron construction. Far beneath them, the
        streets of Paris stretched out in all directions.&lt;i&gt;Almost there, &lt;/i&gt;the boy told himself, craning
        his neck and looking up at the unloading platform. &lt;i&gt;Just hold on.&lt;/i&gt;As the lift angled steeply
        toward the upper viewing deck, the shaft began to narrow, its massive struts contracting into a tight, vertical
        tunnel.&quot;Dad, I don't think&amp;mdash;&quot;Suddenly a staccato crack echoed overhead. The carriage jerked,
        swaying awkwardly to one side. Frayed cables began whipping around the carriage, thrashing like snakes. The boy
        reached out for his father.&quot;Dad!&quot;Their eyes locked for one terrifying second.Then the bottom dropped
        out.Robert Langdon jolted upright in his soft leather seat, startling out of the semiconscious daydream. He was
        sitting all alone in the enormous cabin of a Falcon 2000EX corporate jet as it bounced its way through
        turbulence. In the background, the dual Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney engines hummed evenly.&quot;Mr. Langdon?&quot;
        The intercom crackled overhead. &quot;We're on final approach.&quot;Langdon sat up straight and slid his lecture
        notes back into his leather daybag. He'd been halfway through reviewing Masonic symbology when his mind had
        drifted. The daydream about his late father, Langdon suspected, had been stirred by this morning's unexpected
        invitation from Langdon's longtime mentor, Peter Solomon.&lt;i&gt;The other man I never want to disappoint.&lt;/i&gt;The
        fifty-eight-year-old philanthropist, historian, and scientist had taken Langdon under his wing nearly thirty
        years ago, in many ways filling the void left by Langdon's father's death. Despite the man's influential family
        dynasty and massive wealth, Langdon had found humility and warmth in Solomon's soft gray eyes.Outside the window
        the sun had set, but Langdon could still make out the slender silhouette of the world's largest obelisk, rising
        on the horizon like the spire of an ancient gnomon. The 555-foot marble-faced obelisk marked this nation's
        heart. All around the spire, the meticulous geometry of streets and monuments radiated outward.Even from the
        air, Washington, D.C., exuded an almost mystical power.Langdon loved this city, and as the jet touched down, he
        felt a rising excitement about what lay ahead. The jet taxied to a private terminal somewhere in the vast
        expanse of Dulles International Airport and came to a stop.Langdon gathered his things, thanked the pilots, and
        stepped out of the jet's luxurious interior onto the foldout staircase. The cold January air felt liberating.&lt;i&gt;Breathe,
        Robert, &lt;/i&gt;he thought, appreciating the wide-open spaces.A blanket of white fog crept across the runway,
        and Langdon had the sensation he was stepping into a marsh as he descended onto the misty tarmac.&quot;Hello!
        Hello!&quot; a singsong British voice shouted from across the tarmac. &quot;Professor Langdon?&quot;Langdon
        looked up to see a middle-aged woman with a badge and clipboard hurrying toward him, waving happily as he
        approached. Curly blond hair protruded from under a stylish knit wool hat.&quot;Welcome to Washington, sir!&quot;Langdon
        smiled. &quot;Thank you.&quot;&quot;My name is Pam, from passenger services.&quot; The woman spoke with an
        exuberance that was almost unsettling. &quot;If you'll come with me, sir, your car is waiting.&quot;Langdon
        followed her across the runway toward the Signature terminal, which was surrounded by glistening private jets.
        &lt;i&gt;A taxi stand for the rich and famous.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;I hate to embarrass you, Professor,&quot; the
        woman said, sounding sheepish, &quot;but you &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;the Robert Langdon who writes books about
        symbols and religion, aren't you?&quot;Langdon hesitated and then nodded.&quot;I thought so!&quot; she said,
        beaming. &quot;My book group read your book about the sacred feminine and the church! What a delicious scandal
        that one caused! You do enjoy putting the fox in the henhouse!&quot;Langdon smiled. &quot;Scandal wasn't really
        my intention.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The woman seemed to sense Langdon was not in the mood to discuss his
        work. &quot;I'm sorry. Listen to me rattling on. I know you probably get tired of being recognized . . . but
        it's your own fault.&quot; She playfully motioned to his clothing. &quot;Your uniform gave you away.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;My
        uniform? &lt;/i&gt;Langdon glanced down at his attire. He was wearing his usual charcoal turtleneck, Harris
        Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers . . . his standard attire for the classroom, lecture
        circuit, author photos, and social events.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The woman laughed. &quot;Those turtlenecks you
        wear are so dated. You'd look much sharper in a tie!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;No chance, &lt;/i&gt;Langdon
        thought. &lt;i&gt;Little nooses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neckties had been required six days a week when
        Langdon attended Phillips Exeter Academy, and despite the headmaster's romantic claims that the origin of the
        cravat went back to the silk &lt;i&gt;fascalia &lt;/i&gt;worn by Roman orators to warm their vocal cords,
        Langdon knew that, etymologically, &lt;i&gt;cravat &lt;/i&gt;actually derived from a ruthless band of &quot;Croat&quot;
        mercenaries who donned knotted neckerchiefs before they stormed into battle. To this day, this ancient battle
        garb was donned by modern office warriors hoping to intimidate their enemies in daily boardroom battles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Thanks
        for the advice,&quot; Langdon said with a chuckle. &quot;I'll consider a tie in the future.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mercifully,
        a professional-looking man in a dark suit got out of a sleek Lincoln Town Car parked near the terminal and held
        up his finger. &quot;Mr. Langdon? I'm Charles with Beltway Limousine.&quot; He opened the passenger door. &quot;Good
        evening, sir. Welcome to Washington.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Langdon tipped Pam for her hospitality and then
        climbed into the plush interior of the Town Car. The driver showed him the temperature controls, the bottled
        water, and the basket of hot muffins. Seconds later, Langdon was speeding away on a private access road. &lt;i&gt;So
        this is how the other half lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the driver gunned the car up Windsock Drive,
        he consulted his passenger manifest and placed a quick call. &quot;This is Beltway Limousine,&quot; the driver
        said with professional efficiency. &quot;I was asked to confirm once my passenger had landed.&quot; He paused.
        &quot;Yes, sir. Your guest, Mr. Langdon, has arrived, and I will deliver him to the Capitol Building by seven
        P.M. You're welcome, sir.&quot; He hung up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Langdon had to smile. &lt;i&gt;No stone left
        unturned&lt;/i&gt;. Peter Solomon's attention to detail was one of his most potent assets, allowing him to
        manage his substantial power with apparent ease. &lt;i&gt;A few billion dollars in the bank doesn't hurt either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Langdon
        settled into the plush leather seat and closed his eyes as the noise of the airport faded behind him. The U.S.
        Capitol was a half hour away, and he appreciated the time alone to gather his thoughts. Everything had happened
        so quickly today that Langdon only now had begun to think in earnest about the incredible evening that lay
        ahead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arriving under a veil of secrecy, &lt;/i&gt;Langdon thought, amused by the
        prospect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten miles from the Capitol Building, a lone figure was eagerly preparing for Robert
        Langdon's arrival.

    <rgcopy>In this stunning follow-up to the global phenomenon &lt;i&gt;The Da Vinci Code,&lt;/i&gt; Dan Brown
        demonstrates once again why he is the world's most popular thriller writer. &lt;i&gt;The Lost Symbol&lt;/i&gt;
        is a masterstroke of storytelling&amp;mdash;a deadly race through a real-world labyrinth of codes, secrets, and
        unseen truths . . . all under the watchful eye of Brown's most terrifying villain to date. Set within the hidden
        chambers, tunnels, and temples of Washington, D.C., &lt;i&gt;The Lost Symbol&lt;/i&gt; accelerates through a
        startling landscape toward an unthinkable finale.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; As the story opens, Harvard symbologist
        Robert Langdon is summoned unexpectedly to deliver an evening lecture in the U.S. Capitol Building. Within
        minutes of his arrival, however, the night takes a bizarre turn. A disturbing object&amp;mdash;artfully encoded
        with five symbols&amp;mdash;is discovered in the Capitol Building. Langdon recognizes the object as an ancient
        invitation . . . one meant to usher its recipient into a long-lost world of esoteric wisdom.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
        When Langdon's beloved mentor, Peter Solomon&amp;mdash;a prominent Mason and philanthropist&amp;mdash;is
        brutally kidnapped, Langdon realizes his only hope of saving Peter is to accept this mystical invitation and
        follow wherever it leads him. Langdon is instantly plunged into a clandestine world of Masonic secrets, hidden
        history, and never-before-seen locations&amp;mdash;all of which seem to be dragging him toward a single,
        inconceivable truth.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; As the world discovered in &lt;i&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/i&gt; and
        &lt;i&gt;Angels &amp;amp; Demons&lt;/i&gt;, Dan Brown's novels are brilliant tapestries of veiled histories,
        arcane symbols, and enigmatic codes. In this new novel, he again challenges readers with an intelligent,
        lightning-paced story that offers surprises at every turn. &lt;i&gt;The Lost Symbol &lt;/i&gt;is exactly what
        Brown's fans have been waiting for . . . his most thrilling novel yet.

    <rgdiscussion>&lt;p&gt;1. How familiar were you with Freemasonry before reading the novel? How did your impressions
        of the organization shift throughout the book, from the chilling prologue to Peter Solomon's philosophical
        comments near the end?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. How do Peter Solomon's students (including Robert) reconcile their
        admiration for him with the knowledge that he is a Mason? Did it surprise you to learn about well-known American
        historical figures who were Masons and to read about scientists who were intrigued by mysticism and other occult
        belief systems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Discuss the novel's grand theme of architecture. How did &lt;i&gt;The Lost
        Symbol&lt;/i&gt; change the way you think about the way buildings are designed and the intention of their
        architects&amp;mdash;their creators? What most surprised you about the tributes to the past&amp;mdash;and
        visions of the future&amp;mdash;that are captured in the landmarks of Washington, D.C.?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.
        Mal'akh considers the polarity of angels and demons, noting that &quot;the guardian angel who conquered your
        enemy in battle was perceived by your enemy as a demon destroyer.&quot; What does this indicate about Mal'akh's
        perception of himself in the world? How can his evil nature be explained? Why is he able to consider only his
        own suffering, while relishing the suffering of others?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. How did you react to Katherine
        Solomon's work in Noetic Science? What motivates her to investigate the tangible aspects of the human soul
        (attempting to weigh it, even)? How would it change the world if there were more tangible evidence of the
        spiritual world? How is Katherine Solomon's perception of science different from Robert Langdon's?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6.
        At the heart of the novel is a quest to unlock wisdom despite the need to keep it &quot;locked&quot; since it
        can be used for destructive purposes. Do you believe that freedom of knowledge (Wikipedia, the World Wide Web)
        is a blessing or a curse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. The novel's epigraph, from Manly Hall's &lt;i&gt;The Secret
        Teachings of All Ages&lt;/i&gt;, encourages readers to become aware of the meaning of the world. What mysteries
        about the world, and life, do you think are the most important ones to explore?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. How does
        Mal'akh amass enough power to turn his personal plot into a national security threat? What does his rise to
        power indicate about the potential of mind over body and a human being's ability to play a variety of roles for
        unsuspecting audiences?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. The final chapter raises intriguing questions about the possibility
        of a multifaceted God and the potential to find God in all of humanity. Can there be a universal definition of
        enlightenment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10. While interpreting the Masonic Pyramid's final inscription, Robert Langdon
        tries to bring order out of chaos by interpreting each symbol as a metaphor. Peter Solomon instructs him to be
        literal and accept the inscription as a true map. What does this exchange say about the best way to interpret
        all sacred messages?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11. In the epilogue what truths do Katherine Solomon and Robert Langdon
        experience, at sunris atop America's ultimate symbol? From your perspective, what does the Capitol symbolize?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12.
        What does &lt;i&gt;The Lost Symbol&lt;/i&gt; indicate about the power of the word&amp;mdash;whether ancient
        texts or bestselling twenty-first-century novels?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;13. What common thread runs through this and
        each of Dan Brown's previous works? What makes &lt;i&gt;The Lost Symbol&lt;/i&gt; unique? How has Robert
        Langdon's perspective changed from &lt;i&gt;Angels &amp;amp; Demons&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(For
